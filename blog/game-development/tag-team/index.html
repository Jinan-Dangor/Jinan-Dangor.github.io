<p><strong>Project Status:</strong> In Development</p>
<p>Tag Team is a competitive videogame like Cine2Nerdle where you jump between Steam games using their tags.</p>
<p>You can access its codebase <a href="https://github.com/Jinan-Dangor/TagTeam-Videogame-Battle">here</a>.</p>
<p>This project involved developing a system for retrieving game data from Steam. Once this project is completed, these tools will be refactored and documented for public use.</p>
