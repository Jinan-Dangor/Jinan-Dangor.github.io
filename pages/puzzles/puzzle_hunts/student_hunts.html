Spanning an entire year, the student-themed puzzle hunts were themed after helping some students through problems they were having at uni.
Tragically, the meta-hunt, The Final Exam, never got played due to the real life final exams of myself and my friends.
<br><br>
The hunts were as follows:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dBP2jbO9LKxxRlqTsn67S1oaEm8BxbjV/view?usp=sharing">The MedSci Student</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kB6PBoWoTWPvHpd7zePmcEYSKkrfiJMC/view?usp=sharing">The Engineering Student</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p0zRgwMsmHbgt6PE3jXnUAlfdGJEc7_v/view?usp=sharing">The AFTRS Student</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sEo7U0VdIjRLcxNlAamS528Br_0WE7gP/view?usp=sharing">The Business Student</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uYJYq_mA7PjL5DmJKwzdlxZeSwZboQSd/view?usp=sharing">The Final Exam</a></li>
</ul>
The student races each involved 6 puzzles and a meta-puzzle.
The Final Exam involves 4 puzzles, each of which utilises one of the previous four hunts in a novel way.

Any puzzles no longer solvable due to physical exhibits or otherwise have been signposted.
