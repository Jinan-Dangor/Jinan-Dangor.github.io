<h1> {{page.subcategory}} </h1>

Tournament Arc was my second puzzle hunt, and with the help of some friends was significantly larger than the first.
You can find it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RxgSN5HhrSnFL4-9kM1eIB4-OUmFvGd5/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
<br><br>
It contains 18 puzzles and a metapuzzle.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, several of the puzzles are now unsolvable thanks to relying on knowledge specific to my college.
<br>The following features suffer from this problem:
<ul>
    <li>Coffee Break - <span class="spoiler">The campus Coffee Cart served all the coffees this puzzle references.
        It should still be solvable, just more difficult (I'm relatively sure most of these coffees are standard).</span></li>
    <li>The Best Friend - <span class="spoiler">This puzzle references group themes,
        as hidden in each group was a letter attached to some object or piece of furniture.</span></li>
</ul>
