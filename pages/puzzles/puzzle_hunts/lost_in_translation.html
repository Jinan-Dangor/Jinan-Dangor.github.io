<h1> {{page.subcategory}} </h1>

Outer Wilds is one of my favourite games of all time, I couldn't resist making a hunt for it.
If you haven't played Outer Wilds (you should) this hunt's lore and the theme of the puzzles will make less sense.
That said, it is also spoiler-light, so if you solve this hunt before playing the game it shouldn't spoil much for you.

It involves 6 puzzles and a meta-puzzle, and can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1opdRUFyi3UeZhPd89-on2U2APPCBlg9M/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
