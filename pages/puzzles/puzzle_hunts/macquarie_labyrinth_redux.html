<h1> {{page.subcategory}} </h1>

I found out after I left highschool that apparently people were still reviving <a href="macquarie_lbyrinth.html">the labyrinth</a>,
which is fantastic news for the future of puzzling.
<br><br>
One year, my younger sister asked if I could author a new labyrinth, which I did, though I have reason to believe the email containing these puzzles may
have rotted away in someone's inbox. Either way, this new labyrinth much more resembles a standard puzzle hunt, and in some places reuses
puzzle formats from my earlier hunts.
<br><br>
It contains 6 puzzles and meta-puzzle, and can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15DZqnch7MuGgNOTDoh4rqSPqey_npLkt/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
