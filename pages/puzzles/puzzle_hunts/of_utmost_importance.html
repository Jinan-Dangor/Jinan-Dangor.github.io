<h1> {{page.subcategory}} </h1>

Of Utmost Importance was my first ever proper puzzle hunt, and I themed it after finding the most 'important parts' of different aspects of college.
You can find it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T2AaE61vkMe3_DZ9netCjIPVSI-xcG44/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
<br><br>
It contains 6 puzzles and a meta-round featuring 4 puzzles tied together by a meta.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, several of the puzzles are now unsolvable thanks to relying on knowledge specific to my college.
<br>The following features suffer from this problem:
<ul>
    <li>Even Fresher Dances - <span class="spoiler">This puzzle revolved around 'Fresher Dances', dances taught to freshmen during the first week of the year.
        For anyone not at college, know that you're looking for pop songs to fill the blanks.</span></li>
    <li>Misattributed - <span class="spoiler">Everyone in college got a 'fresher name', a nickname which everyone tried to insist they be called by.
        This puzzle involved matching collegians to their fresher names.
        Once you have a set of full names that match the number of blanks at the bottom of the puzzle, you've gone as far as you can.</span></li>
</ul>
