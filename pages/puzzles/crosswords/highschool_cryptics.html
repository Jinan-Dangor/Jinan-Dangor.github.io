Back in highschool, I somehow conned the staff into letting me post a weekly Cryptic Crossword (which, to my knowledge, no one solved, nor tried to solve).
<br><br>
That said, I had a wonderful time amusing myself with making these puzzles (it was the first time I'd done so), and now I've digitised them for your puzzling pleasure.

<a href="highschool_cryptics/highschool_cryptic_02.html">Cryptic 02 - The Spanish Inquisition</a><br>
<a href="highschool_cryptics/highschool_cryptic_03.html">Cryptic 03 - A Holiday Within a Holiday</a><br>

<br>
It's worth noting that I like to use 'I guess' to signify nomenclature puns, which may be used as definition or wordplay.
<br>For example, "...to call again, I guess..." might clue RECALL, or "...in support of tect..." might clue PROTECT.
<br>No words used in such a clue will be charaded or otherwise obscured, so RECALL would not be clued by "...to ring again, I guess...".
