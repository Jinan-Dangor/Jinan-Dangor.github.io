<h1> {{page.category}} </h1>

I've made a few crosswords around the place, sometimes in service of puzzle hunts, sometimes not.
Here you can find crosswords I didn't make for some larger event or hunt.
<br><br>
The <a href="crosswords/rotational_symmetry.html">crossword with rotational symmetry</a> is a crossword with a fun gimick I made a few years back.
<br><br>
I also made a bunch of <a href="crosswords/highschool_cryptics.html">cryptic crosswords in highschool</a> that I think stand up pretty well.
