<h1> {{page.subcategory}} </h1>

My general pattern of TRPG development tends to be running one thing while developing two others.
<br><br>
As such, I have a lot of adventures to show, but some aren't written up the best they could or otherwise aren't ready to post online.
<br><br>
These include:
<ul>
    <li>An ancient Mage's Guild has been recently uncovered deep in the woods.
        Discover why its abandoned in this mystery puzzle adventure!</li>
    <li>I ran a <a href="https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/spire-rpg/">Spire</a> game in late 2022.
        It went for about 12 sessions and was a tonne of fun.
        I plan on doing a writeup of some of the materials I made and used so that others can run a similar campaign if desired.</li>
    <li>I love the TRPG system <a href="https://dreadthegame.wordpress.com/about-dread-the-game/">Dread</a>,
        and have run a few one-shots in it, two of which were of my own design.
        One is a horror scenario set in a college getaway in the Australian outback.
        The other is a Shadowrun-style heist with a flashback system Ã  la Blades in the Dark.</li>
</ul>
