<h1> {{page.category}} </h1>

I'd say I started properly DMing campaigns around 2018.
To be very clear, the sessions and campaigns I came up with around then were ok, but not great.
<br><br>
I was largely just making up cool stuff and trying out ideas with any rigorous design behind anything I was doing.
Everyone still ended up having a lot of fun, but most of that content isn't worth transcribing and sharing.
<br><br>
I have a few <a href="dungeons/dungeons_in_development.html">campaigns in development</a> at the moment (that are either being written or written up)
but I am proud to share <a href="dungeons/mm_tomb_of_horrors.html">this Macchiato Monsters adaptation of Tomb of Horrors</a>
that I found works as a good introduction to trpgs.
