I like to design homebrew TRPG systems, sometimes for specific settings or campaigns, sometimes to evoke a particular experience in those that use it.
<br><br>
Here you can find several of these systems, though some are still <a href="homebrew/systems_in_development.html">in development</a>.
<br><br>
<a href="homebrew/cortex.html">Cortex</a> is a mystery TRPG system where each player controls one part of a detective's mind.
It's designed both to help players roleplay as well as give the DM writing prompts for a mystery.
<br><br>
<a href="homebrew/morbus_sanctum.html">Morbus Sanctum</a> is a TRPG system based on humorism, where you gain powers the further your infection with the plague grows.
<br><br>
<a href="homebrew/sunless_city.html">Sunless City</a> is a TRPG system made for the <a href="https://www.fallenlondon.com/">Fallen London</a> universe.
It's designed to be accessible and to encourage players to make a richly flavoured characters that make meaningful choices.
