<h1> {{page.subcategory}} </h1>

I wanted to run a TRPG campaign in the <a href="https://www.fallenlondon.com/">Fallen London</a> universe back in 2021 and the existing fan systems weren't doing it for me
(even <a href="https://www.failbettergames.com/news/skyfarer-a-sunless-skies-rpg">Skyfarer</a>, which has some excellent design behind it,
didn't quite feel like what I wanted my campaign to be).
<br><br>
So, I made my own! You can find it, a character sheet and some references for new players
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KfQ_K1bTIqwy62FttSQ8-KggIvyHBY-h?usp=sharing">here</a>.
<br><br>
I tried to make the system simple and lightweight, with a lot of room for collaborative storytelling and opportunities to engage with Fallen London's flavour.
<br><br>
Your equipment, for example, is immaterial - mechanically speaking, there's no difference between two different items that give the same quality bonuses.
This means players can pretty quickly and easily make mechanical choices about their character and move on to make choices about their character's flavour.
<br><br>
Similarly, many rewards and items belong on The Carousel, which puts items into tiers and categories.
Your Tier 2 Revelry item could become any number of things to suit the situation - an invitation to an exclusive debutante ball, or perhaps a cellar full of exceptional vintages.
Your players get to stop worrying about every little thing on their person and instead combine their creativity and knowledge of the setting to overcome challenges.
<br><br>
The campaign I ran in this system was based on the Light Fingers Ambition, a campaign I intend to run again with significant changes.
The first time around I kept the somewhat linear progression of original game, not taking advantage of the non-linearity TRPGs excel at.
<br><br>
Once I've run it again, I might do a write-up of the campaign in case anyone else wants to run it.
