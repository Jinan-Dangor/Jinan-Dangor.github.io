<h1> {{page.subcategory}} </h1>

There's several TRPG systems and subsystems I've got in the works, which I look forward to sharing when they're in a state where that's possible.

Candidates include:
<ul>
    <li>A freeform spellcasting system that lends some structure to 'words of power' systems.
        All the best parts of this system are hard to describe succinctly, but I'm really liking how it's shaping up.
    </li>
    <li>A survival horror game where you play as killer robots tormenting and murdering highschool students.
        As bizarre as this claim may sound given this premise, it's based on a true story.
        Your goal as the robots is to engage with mechanics that encourage pacing your attack like a horror film,
        slowly raising tension and terrifying your targets before engaging with them directly.
    </li>
</ul>
