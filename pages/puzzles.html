<h1>Puzzles</h1>

Here you can find the wide selection of puzzles I've developed ever since I was in highschool.
<br><br>
My <a href="puzzles/crosswords.html">puzzle hunts</a> are probably the biggest attraction.
I've made quite a few of them over the years.
<br><br>
Many of them feature in my puzzle hunts, but I've also made a few isolated <a href="puzzles/crosswords.html">crosswords</a> in my time.
<br><br>
And of course there's a few <a href="puzzles/crosswords.html">other puzzles</a> that don't have an umbrella classification.
