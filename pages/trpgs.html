<h1>Tabletop RolePlaying Games</h1>

I love TRPGs! I'm one of the perma-DMs who's run more games than they've played.
In the process I've made my fair share of <a href="trpgs/dungeons.html">campaigns and encounters</a>
as well as a bunch of <a href="trpgs/dungeons.html">my own systems</a>.

A lot of my work doesn't end up being worth posting online
(sometimes my work is half in my head and half in a spreadsheet, and the former half requires some work before I can post it online).
That said, who knows when I'll be struck with the inspiration to write up a successful adventure?
